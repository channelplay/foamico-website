# The Complete Guide to Better Sleep: Science-Backed Tips

Good sleep is the foundation of good health. Yet, millions of people struggle to get the quality rest they need. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore science-backed strategies to improve your sleep quality.

## Understanding Sleep Cycles

Sleep isn't just one continuous state. Throughout the night, your body cycles through different stages:

- **Light Sleep (N1 & N2)**: The transition from wakefulness to sleep
- **Deep Sleep (N3)**: Critical for physical recovery and growth
- **REM Sleep**: Essential for mental health and memory consolidation

Understanding these cycles helps you optimize your sleep environment and habits.

## The Role of Your Mattress

Your mattress plays a crucial role in sleep quality. Here's what to look for:

### 1. Support
A good mattress should maintain proper spinal alignment. The OrthoSense® technology in Foamico mattresses is specifically designed for Indian body types, ensuring optimal support throughout the night.

### 2. Temperature Regulation
Natural materials like latex allow better airflow, keeping you cool during warm nights. This is especially important in India's climate.

### 3. Motion Isolation
If you share your bed, motion isolation prevents your partner's movements from disturbing your sleep.

## Sleep Hygiene Tips

### Create a Sleep Schedule
- Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day
- Even on weekends, try to maintain consistency
- Your body's internal clock will thank you

### Optimize Your Bedroom Environment
- Keep the room dark with blackout curtains
- Maintain a cool temperature (18-22°C is ideal)
- Minimize noise or use white noise if needed
- Invest in quality bedding that feels comfortable

### Pre-Sleep Routine
1. **Digital Detox**: Put away screens 1 hour before bed
2. **Relaxation**: Try meditation, reading, or gentle stretching
3. **Avoid Stimulants**: No caffeine 6 hours before sleep
4. **Light Dinner**: Heavy meals can disrupt sleep

## Natural Sleep Aids

### Herbal Remedies
- **Chamomile Tea**: Known for its calming properties
- **Ashwagandha**: An Ayurvedic herb that reduces stress
- **Lavender**: Use essential oils for aromatherapy

### Breathing Exercises
The 4-7-8 technique:
1. Inhale for 4 seconds
2. Hold for 7 seconds
3. Exhale for 8 seconds
4. Repeat 3-4 times

## When to Consider a New Mattress

Signs you need a mattress upgrade:
- Waking up with aches and pains
- Your mattress is over 7-8 years old
- Visible sagging or lumps
- Better sleep when away from home
- Increased allergy symptoms

## The Foamico Advantage

# How to Care for Your Mattress: Expert Maintenance Guide

Your mattress is one of the most important investments in your home. With proper care, a quality mattress like Foamico can serve you well for decades. Here's your complete guide to mattress maintenance.

## Daily Care Routine

### Morning Airing
- Pull back your bedding for 30 minutes each morning
- This allows moisture from night sweating to evaporate
- Open windows if possible for fresh air circulation

### Making Your Bed
- Don't make your bed immediately after waking
- Wait at least 30 minutes for the mattress to air out
- Use this time for your morning routine

## Weekly Maintenance

### 1. Vacuum Your Mattress
Use your vacuum's upholstery attachment to:
- Remove dust, dead skin cells, and allergens
- Pay special attention to seams and crevices
- Don't forget the sides of the mattress

### 2. Check for Stains
- Address any stains immediately
- Use appropriate cleaning methods (detailed below)
- Prevention is better than cure

## Monthly Care Tasks

### Rotate Your Mattress
- Rotate 180 degrees every month
- This ensures even wear distribution
- Mark your calendar for consistency

### Inspect for Wear
Look for:
- Sagging or indentations
- Unusual odors
- Any signs of moisture damage

## Seasonal Deep Cleaning

### Spring & Fall Routine
1. **Strip Everything**: Remove all bedding including mattress protectors
2. **Deep Vacuum**: Spend extra time on thorough vacuuming
3. **Spot Clean**: Address any stains you've noticed
4. **Deodorize**: Sprinkle baking soda, leave for hours, then vacuum
5. **Sun Exposure**: If possible, let sunlight hit the mattress

## Stain Removal Guide

### General Stains
1. Blot (don't rub) with cold water
2. Mix mild detergent with water
3. Apply with spray bottle
4. Blot with clean cloth
5. Let dry completely

### Specific Stains

**Blood**:
- Cold water + hydrogen peroxide
- Blot gently, don't soak

**Sweat/Yellow Stains**:
- White vinegar + water (1:1 ratio)
- Spray and blot
- Follow with baking soda

**Food/Drinks**:
- Enzyme cleaner works best
- Follow product instructions
- Always test on hidden area first

## Protecting Your Investment

### Use a Mattress Protector
- Waterproof yet breathable
- Wash monthly
- Replace yearly

### Quality Bedding
- Use breathable, natural fiber sheets
- Wash bedding weekly in hot water
- Have multiple sets for rotation

- Ensure good ventilation

## Special Care for Natural Latex

Foamico's natural latex mattresses need specific care:
